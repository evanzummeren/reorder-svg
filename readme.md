# reorderSvg.js
This module currently accepts an array of stringified polygons. It then calculates the center point 
of each SVG polygon, after which it reorders the polygons on either the
X or Y position it's center point. It accepts 8 ordering formats (see settings: order).

At this moment it only supports points. Svg shapes exported through Adobe 
Illustrator (points divided by spaces) and the W3C standard (X and Y point attached by
comma and coordinates seperated through spaces) are both supported.

## Installation
```npm install reorder-svg```

## Usage
```reorderSvg(shapes, order).then(result => console.log(result));```

### Settings
